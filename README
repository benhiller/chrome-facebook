Facebook for Google Chrome extension

This branch uses Facebook Connect and will eventually replace the current version. Connect makes it much easier to add more functionality, (ex: notifications, inbox), and is a much cleaner interface.

TODO before release:
  1. Implement caching for data (don't call API everytime user opens popup)
  2. Implement notification updating
  3. Make like show up in list after commenting
  4. Create nice instruction success page after connecting

Later versions:
  Implement 'view all likes'
  Improve handling of swf/video attchs
  Inbox
  Publishing attacments (sites) via extension

Note:
  FB.getLoginStatus() does NOT work, due to using js connect lib in chrome extension
