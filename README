Facebook for Google Chrome extension

This branch uses Facebook Connect, will eventually replace current version. Connect makes it much easier to add more functionality, (ex: notifications, inbox), and is a much cleaner interface.

TODO:
  Implement like buttons
  Make comment/status show up in list/stream after commenting/publishing
  Implement caching for data (don't call API everytime user opens popup)
  Implement 'view all comments/likes'
  Get nice logout icon
  Create nice instruction success page after connecting (and improve welcome screen for ext)
  Implement notification updating, and notification tab
  Implement refresh
  Implement wall

  Why does stream FQL table not seem to include photo stories?

Later:
  Inbox

getLoginStatus does NOT work
