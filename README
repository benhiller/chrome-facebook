Facebook for Google Chrome extension

This branch uses Facebook Connect and will eventually replace the current version. Connect makes it much easier to add more functionality, (ex: notifications, inbox), and is a much cleaner interface.

TODO before release:
  Inbox icon

TODO:
  Make like show up in list after commenting
  Implement 'view all likes'
  Improve handling of swf/video attchs
  Publishing attacments (sites) via extension

Note:
  FB.getLoginStatus() does NOT work, due to using js connect lib in chrome extension
